# Internshala Learning Repository 📚🎓

Welcome to my knowledge hub! This repository documents my learning journey through the various courses, trainings, and resources offered by Internshala.  

## About 📖

I'm passionate about continuously expanding my skills and knowledge, and Internshala has been a fantastic platform for that. Here, I'll be organizing my notes, code, projects, and reflections from each course I take. 

## Course Structure 🗂️

The repository will be organized by course, with each having its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **Code:** Code examples, exercises, and mini-projects completed during the course.
- **Assignments/Projects:**  Major assignments or projects showcasing my practical application of the knowledge gained.
- **Reflections:** My thoughts, insights, and lessons learned from each course.



## How to Navigate 🧭

1. Browse the course folders to find the one you're interested in.
2. Explore the notes, code, assignments, and reflections within each folder.
3. Feel free to leave comments or questions if you have any.
